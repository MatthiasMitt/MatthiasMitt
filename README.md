- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MatthiasMitt . I was part of large scale software production in earlier years. But now I do some software for fun only.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
    - mainly because I was looking for a programming language I can use on an iPad when sitting on the sofa.
- I started with FORTRAN, ALGOL-60 and ASSEMBLER. I used PASCAL for some years. Since 1981 I used C an sh mainly.
 
My mother tongue is German, my English is medium level.
